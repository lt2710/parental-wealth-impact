# parental-wealth-impact
Using sequence analysis and various regressions to build models on wealth impact. Project with Prof. Spilerman and Prof. Lu from Columbia.

## Data
 - The China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), conducted by China Center for Economic Research at Peking University
 
 - A nationally representative social survey on adults over 45 years old
 
 - Variables and observations reconstruced from information in 2013, 2014, 2015 wave

 - Matched child-father pairs of respondents and their children
 
 ## Summary of findings
 - Higher stock of net worth from parents positively mediate educational attainment of offspring controling other cultural, occupational and institutional advantages

 - Some children, more likely male and only child, are gifted home by parents upon marriage, which significantly increases their chance to become homeowners

 - Higher net worth of parents is also associated with higher home value holdings among children, net of the functioning of children's achieved status and other parental resources

## Thoughts and forward
 - Parental economic resources become more pronouncing, translating to indirect advantage of educational attainment for further building of better life chance and living standard, undermining education's role in facilitating equity and mobility

 - More directly, by gift upon marriage and other inter vivo transfers, parental wealth facilitate home/asset ownership, strengthening intergenerational contract, improving children's living standard potential, and passing on accumulated economic resources
 
 - The impact might expand if the opportunity structure in Chinese society continue to increasingly rewards more for human capital and economic power (while less for political capital and institutional advantage)
 
 - Such transmission might constitute part of a chain from the political/institutional advantage at parental generation to the converted economic power, then to the persistence of it in the offpsring
 
 -The mechanism is embedded in the process of China's macro-structural social transformation in the past decades, which would reveal how the priviledged manage to pass on their resources
